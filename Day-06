PROCESS MANAGEMENT:
===================
root process 
0 => PID
1 => PID
          Every Child ID will have Parent ID
PID    PPID        
2       0
3       1

ps => Process started by the current user
ps -ef => All process
ps -ef | grep sleep
top  =>  this will give all process deatils and resources details.
background process  ==>  sleep 100 & --> will run in background
foreground process ==> sleep 100 --> blocks the screen we can't do anything

kill PID ==> Terminates the process
kill -9 PID  ==> Kills the process forcefully

Whenever services hung, Get all the logs, app logs, DB logs, Serverlogs etc..  Kill the process and restart the service.
We always Monitor CPU RAM utilizations and send ALERTS when set limits exceeds.


3 Tier Architecture:
====================
Desktop apps => old days => Consume more resources, install upgrade repair, data stores in local pc, Antivirus needed, No Remote access..etc problems..
Web Apps => Everything we can access over server and all above issues are sorted.

User ==> LoadBalancer ==> Web Server ==> APP Server ==> DB Server

Load Balancer can be public and private types based on where we want to keep.

Data is everything and it is of three forms: Structured , Semi-Structured and Un Structured Data.

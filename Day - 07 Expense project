Expense Project Manual way of setup:
====================================

Linux Server(pyhsical server) inside it ==> DB Server (Software Server)

Create 3 EC2 instances

To connect we can use any clients like git bash, MobaXterm, putty etc.. If you are Mac/Linux users you already have terminals to connect no need of any clients.

Install MobaXterm for windows(your choice) It will help us to use multiple instances in different tabs, navigation is flexible comapared to git bash.

After installation open and in SSH give IP, it will ask for user name and password, enter details and connect with machines. You can rename tabs for easy navigation b/w mutliple tabs.

SQL == Structured Query Language
RDBMS == Relational Data Base Managemet System ( Oracle, MySql, MSSql, postgress etc..)  Data stores in Table and Columns approach. With Primary Key Foreign Key approach data can be looked into.
Excel sheets we don't have options of relations.

Install mysql-server then start and enable it. 
default port ==>  3306
default user ==>  root

To connect with mysql-server, we would need client i.e, mysql (when you install mysql-server it automatically installs mysql client as well)

Login to mysql client and search for databases(schema(Tables)) ==> show databases;

Client and Server Architecture : Any device is providing some kind of service we can consider as Server and the device which is consuming/requesting something from it can be called as client.
===============================

Client and Sever defintions purely depends on case to case basis. for example: your pc is connected with mobile and fetching phots from gallery. here mobile is server and pc is client. if you are trying to get/control
your pc with mobile and getting info then pc becomes server and mobile becomes client.

Authentications and Authorisations:
===================================
username and password                          ====> Least secured
Tokens/OTP/Access keys etc                      ===> medium secure
Fingerprints, retina, thumb impressions etc..   ===> High secure way

Now a days almost every application is mandated Two factor or multifactor authentication to secure systems and data.

Expense Project Manual way of setup:
====================================

Linux Server(pyhsical server) inside it ==> DB Server (Software Server)

Create 3 EC2 instances

To connect we can use any clients like git bash, MobaXterm, putty etc.. If you are Mac/Linux users you already have terminals to connect no need of any clients.

Install MobaXterm for windows(your choice) It will help us to use multiple instances in different tabs, navigation is flexible comapared to git bash.

After installation open and in SSH give IP, it will ask for user name and password, enter details and connect with machines. You can rename tabs for easy navigation b/w mutliple tabs.

SQL == Structured Query Language
RDBMS == Relational Data Base Managemet System ( Oracle, MySql, MSSql, postgress etc..)  Data stores in Table and Columns approach. With Primary Key Foreign Key approach data can be looked into.
Excel sheets we don't have options of relations.

Install mysql-server then start and enable it. 
default port ==>  3306
default user ==>  root

To connect with mysql-server, we would need client i.e, mysql (when you install mysql-server it automatically installs mysql client as well)
Login to mysql client and search for databases(schema(Tables)) ==> show databases;

mysql > show databases;
      > use transactions;
      > show tables;
      > select * from transactions;

Backend language here nodejs 20 version they are using.
To Run any application we would need to create system user, just to run the apps.

system users don't need password to create, just username.

package.json => build file contains all the data and dependencies details
npm => build tool to download dependencies from internet which are listed on package.json

for java pom.xml for python requirements.txt
maven and pip are buidl tools for the same above

npm install ==> reads package.json and downloads them.

.service files ==>  /etc/systemd/system/ ==> *.service all files stay here

publice IP vs private IP ==> External interface vs Internal interface

Before starting the backend service Install mysql and load schema to DB from back end service and then start the backend service. without schema load it will fails.
